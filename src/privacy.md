## BLUE SKIES MASSAGE & WELLNESS PRIVACY POLICY

By your use of this website including the groundworksmassage.com Website and Store(“the Site”), you demonstrate your agreement to comply with this Privacy Policy, which is part of our Terms of Service. That agreement is a condition of your use of our website, and you are bound by it.

### ONE: INFORMATION, USE, and COOKIES

When you visit our website, some kinds of information are gathered automatically. These kinds of information may include the date and time, your IP address, the operating system on your computer including mobile devices, which browser and language you’re using, which websites you visited before ours. Your IP address, short for Internet Protocol address, can be used to find your location, too. We also use the common practice of keeping track of how you interact with our website: which pages you visit in what order, what things you clicked or otherwise interacted with, and other actions you take or don’t take. We collect metadata and other details about these things.

We also collect certain information that you enter yourself as you go through the online purchase process, such as your name, address, and email address. That information allows us to access your order history as well, as long as things match up. In addition, as is common practice in websites generally and e-stores in particular, we may also collect data that’s generated as you move about the website, such as cookies. For those processes we use tags, transparent gifs, and other methods to collect information in order to improve your experience on our website.

When you provide your email address to us, you are giving us permission to email you about products, promotions, and so on from us or from select partners of ours. We may use specific information we gathered about you to help select which communications to send you about new or existing products, events and promotions, and other marketing purposes. Of course you may unsubscribe whenever you want. Just click that link in any of the email we send.

We use all this information to improve your and others’ experience on our website, and to help us to improve the way we operate our business, including decisions about what information consumers seek, what products they want, and how best to sell them. We also use it to reply to your direct requests and otherwise respond to technical support and help needs. We also use your information, collected as described above, for at least the following additional purposes:

To establish and maintain general security of the website, including detection, investigation, deterrence, and prevention of unauthorized use of the website
To create your account, if any, and manage your account credentials, e.g. so that we know it’s you trying to log on.
To email or otherwise send you confirmations and invoices, updates and shipping notices, and correspondence of a more technical or administrative nature such as notifications of changes to this privacy policy or notices about security issues.
To combine with other information from third party sources in an effort to derive more information, such as better ideas about what products to make, or to offer you, and generally to provide a better experience and enhanced services to you.

### TWO: CONSENT AND WITHDRAWAL

You grant us your consent to gather and use information as described above by using the website in general, and by buying any product or service, placing any order, and arranging for any delivery or return of a purchase. Your consent is transferrable to any party who acquires it as part of Groundworks Therapeutic Massage LLC’s business assets, albeit subject to the same protections set forth in this Privacy Policy. You can withdraw your consent by email to info@groundworksmassage.com or regular mail to :

Groundworks Therapeutic Massage
10715 Hobbs Station Rd
Louisville, KY 40223

### THREE: DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

We protect your information and make reasonable commercial efforts to prevent its disclosure to third parties without your consent, except:

As may be required by law, such as in response to a search warrant or court order, or in response to imminent threat, in an effort to protect the personal safety of any person. In the event we are required to disclose your personal information under this exception, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of that fact;
As may be necessary to protect our own rights, such as to enforce contracts, our Terms of Service, or Privacy Policy
As occurs in the ordinary course of business with third parties who work for us, such contract laborers, IT services providers, or others, although we bind such parties to at least the same level of protection of that information as we require of ourselves in this Privacy Policy;
As may be necessary or advisable in the course of contemplated or actual changes to Groundworks Therapeutic Massage LLC’s company structure or financing, such as in a merger, buyout, bankruptcy proceeding, or any other transfer or evaluation of business Groundworks Therapeutic Massage LLC’s assets.
Our reasonable commercial efforts to protect your information include not only the payment processing method discussed below, but also generally accepted industry practices to protect against loss, unauthorized disclosure, or misuse. Your password is a primary means of protecting your information—don’t share it with anyone, and note that best practices require use of a different one for each website. Groundworks Therapeutic Massage LLC will never ask you for password, so never give to anyone representing that they’re from Groundworks Therapeutic Massage LLC.

### FOUR: PAYMENT PROCESSING

At this point, Groundworks Therapeutic Massage’ does not have an e-store, and payments are not handled through this website.  All payments will take place in person, or via 3rd party apps like Venmo or GPay or Apple Pay.

By your use of the Site you demonstrate your agreement to be bound by those third-parties’ privacy policies and further consent to and authorize the Company to share any information and payment instructions you provide with additional third party providers as necessary, to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.

### FIVE: EXTERNAL SITES

You may find links on our website to external sites run by third parties. This policy does not apply to those sites; you should read the policies that apply to them to understand their approach to your personal information.

### SIX: APPLICABLE LAW

You are required to know what laws apply to you, and to abide by them, wherever you are in the world. You access our website at your own risk.

Groundworks Therapeutic Massage LLC is a US company. Our website is accordingly intended for use by persons within the United States including its properties (“the US”). If you send us personal information from outside of the US, then by doing so you manifest your consent to the use and disclosure of that information as may be permitted by the laws of the US and its various states, as appropriate, and as is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
